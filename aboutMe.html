            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Hello, I am Joshua, a software engineer/web developer and game developer based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
From a very young age, I have always been intrigued by technology whether it be games or software. 
As a result, when I found out that software engineering would allow for me to create software and programs, 
I knew that I had found my career path. My fascination for software engineering comes from my love for problem-solving and 
debugging. My belief is that regardless if a problem is complex or not, it can be solved through perseverance and utilizing my 
past experience. I have created many web applications in class and through my own personal time.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
I also currently develop games on a platform called Roblox, using Luau. I enjoy creating Roblox games and have so far ventured 
into making two Roblox games. My most recent game is entitled, "Escape!". The goal of my games are to provide users a fun 
experience and also allow for myself to have fun and grow intellectually. My game development venture has allowed for me to 
prepare for the expectations of future software engineering careers by having me practice debugging and problem solving.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
I am currently a Senior, attending the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee on the Anu and Satya Nadella Scholarship. 
The Anu and Satya Nadella Scholarship is a full-ride scholarship offered to 15 incoming freshmen students majoring in the STEM at 
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The scholarship is exclusively for Computer Science, Data Science and 
Information Technology majors only.
I am an avid reader, a huge fan of Dragon Ball, and love playing multiplayer games with my friends on the weekend.</p>
