            <p>Prior to my first year at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, I was awarded the Anu and Satya Nadella Scholarship.
                This is a prestigious full-ride scholarship awarded to incoming freshmen who graduate from a public or private high school 
                in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In order to receive this scholarship, you must be pursuing a degree in for students pursuing 
                computer science, computer engineering, data science, or information technology majors. 
                I was apart of the first cohort of nine students to be awarded this scholarship in Fall 2022. This scholarship has
                been a positive force during my time in college and has contributed to less financial stress for me.
