        Hello! I am a software engineer, web developer and game developer based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
        As a kid, I have always been passionate in the inner functioning of software and video games. 
        One of my core beliefs is that technology are part of the infrastructure that keep our society 
        running. It is imperative that we have technologists who are ready to tackle the problems
        that may arise tomorrow and are passionate in their work like me. With experience in building robust web applications and 
        developing games, I've utilized these experiences to create class and personal projects that I am proud of. 
        Through these projects, I have gain invaluable skills such as debugging, attention-to-detail, 
        and problem solving that will help me be a successful software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
        My goal as a software engineer is to grow intellectually and personally. 
        On the intellectual side, I want to be able to be able to improve my software development expertise, expand my network 
        and be able to create software that change the lives of other. 
        On the personal side, I want to be able to improve my communication skills, build on my 
        teamworking skills, and build community with my co-workers. A successful 
        software engineer is one that loves learning and that's who I am.</p><hr>
