I am a software engineer and game developer based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
As a kid, I have always been passionate in the inner functioning of software and video games. 
One of my core beliefs is that technology are part of the infrastructure that keep our society 
running. It is imperative that we have software engineers who are ready to tackle the problems
that may arise tomorrow and are passionate in their work like me. With experience in Java and 
Lua, I've utilized these experiences to create class projects and develop games on Roblox. 
Through these projects, I have gain invaluable skills such as debugging, attention-to-detail, 
and problem solving that will help me be a successful software engineer. 
My goal as a software engineer is to grow intellectually and personally. 
On the intellectual side, I want to be able to master multiple programming languages, be able 
to create efficient code, and be able to create software that change the lives of other. 
On the personal side, I want to be able to improve my communication skills, build on my 
teamworking skills, and build community with my co-workers. A successful 
software engineer is one that loves learning and that's who I am.</p><hr>
