        <p style="font-size: 20px;">I have worked on countless projects, which has taught me a lot about software
            engineering and development in general. Below are some of the projects 
            I have worked on:

        <h2>Course Enrollment Manager</h2>

            <div>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                In my Intro to Software Engineering, I worked in a team of 4 to create a web application using Django, HTML, and CSS that 
                enabled for professors, students, 
                and administrators to manage course enrollments and other various tasks such enrollment requests and available course 
                based on their respective view. We followed the SCRUM methodology to ensure collaboration and timely completion of work. 
                I was tasked with completing Administrator view, assisted in developing the Student and Professor view and led the unit 
                testing and acceptance testing for the project. We worked on this project for 4 weeks and presented during the final exam 
                week of the Spring 2025 semester. I help lead the live technical demonstration of our project during presentations.</p>

        <h2>Escape!</h2>
        <div class="project">

            </div>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Since January 2025, I have been working on a project called "Escape!". "Escape!" is a game (inspired by Room Escape) where
                every round, players have to escape from a map by 10 minutes. The maps are a combination of obstacle courses 
                (often known as "obbies" by Roblox players) and puzzles. Currently, this project has three maps, I am looking forward
                to adding more content. I am currently working on this project by myself. I am scripting in Lua, creating 3D models for in-game 
                usage, and planning the whole game by myself. This project has allowed for me to practice my attention-to-detail skills, organization skills,
                and problem solving skills. I am very excited as to where this project will lead me.

        <h2>Express Survey Application</h2>
        <div class="project">

            </div>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">This is a personal project that I have been working on for the past few months. 
                The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to fill out a survey and view the results. 
                The application is built using Express.js, Node.js, and SQLite.
                I am currently working on adding more features to the application, such as survey analytics. I am hoping to deploy
                this application soon. This project has been a great way for me to practice my skills in web development and 
                backend programming.

        <h2>Winter Boogie</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <div>
                <img src="Images/WinterBoogie.jpg" height="350vh" width="400vw"><br>
                <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaThai/Winter-Boogie" target="_blank">
                    <img src="Images/github-logo.svg" height="60vh" width="60vw"></a><br>
                    <span><b>Try on GitHub</b></span>
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Winter Boogie is a collaborative project I worked on with a team of four developers for my
                Immersive Technologies and 3D User Interfaces course at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
                This is a Virtual Reality game that was created using Godot 4.4.1, Roblox for some 3D modeling, and the Meta Quest 2. 
                It is an arcade 
                shooter game that contained three rounds. Each round was divided into two parts: a wall dodging section and a 
                combat round. The wall dodging section is simply the user dodging walls using the Human Joystick locomotion 
                technique. The walls approaches the user quicker after every round. The combat part requires the user to be 
                swift and shoot at snowmen that are approaching you from every angle. The snowmen become harder to kill after 
                each round. Between the wall-dodging and combat part, players can use their score to purchase weapons to use in 
                the combat part. This project was presented during final exam week and won 2nd place in a competition
                for consideration for an internship at Discovery World, a science and technology museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
