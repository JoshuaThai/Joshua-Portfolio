        <p>I have worked on countless projects, which has taught me a lot about software
            engineering and development in general. Below are some of the projects 
            I have worked on:

                <p>In my Intro to Software Engineering, I worked in a team of 4 to create a web application using Django, HTML, and CSS that 
                enabled for professors, students, 
                and administrators to manage course enrollments and other various tasks such enrollment requests and available course 
                based on their respective view. We followed the SCRUM methodology to ensure collaboration and timely completion of work. 
                I was tasked with completing Administrator view, assisted in developing the Student and Professor view and led the unit 
                testing and acceptance testing for the project. We worked on this project for 4 weeks and presented during the final exam 
                week of the Spring 2025 semester. I help lead the live technical demonstration of our project during presentations.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Since January 2025, I have been working on a project called "Escape!". "Escape!" is a game (inspired by Room Escape) where
                every round, players have to escape from a map by 10 minutes. The maps are a combination of obstacle courses 
                (often known as "obbies" by Roblox players) and puzzles. Currently, this project has two maps, I am looking forward
                to adding more content. I am currently working on this project by myself. I am scripting in Lua, creating 3D models for in-game 
                usage, and planning the whole game by myself. This project has allowed for me to practice my attention-to-detail skills, organization skills,
                and problem solving skills. I am very excited as to where this project will lead me.
