            <img src="Images/login_Page.png" height="350vh" width="400vw">
            <p>I worked in a team of 4 to create a web application using Django, HTML, and CSS that enabled for professors, students, 
                and administrators to manage course enrollments and other various tasks such enrollment requests and available course 
                based on their respective view. We followed the SCRUM methodology to ensure collaboration and timely completion of work. 
                I was tasked with completing Administrator view and assisted in the Student and Professor view. We worked on this project
                 for 4 weeks and presented during the final exam week of the Spring 2025 semester. I help lead the live technical 
                 demonstration of our project during presentations.</p>
